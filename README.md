# CodeCamper
It is a sample project to demonstrate using ASP.NET, Angular, Breeze, Hibernate, Typescript, Bootstrap I got the based idea and data from John Papa Breeze course in Plural Sight but I developed it by using different technology like NHibernate and Typescript.

Some part of codes of this project copied from different place, you can find notes related to original developer.

But the total idea is show ability of breeze to transfer business objects to UI save it, and I used Angular to develop UI, by this approach we could have a clean server side code just for validation.

This project is on development and not finish completely.
